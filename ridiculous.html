<h2> Don't forget to make your bed! </h2>
<p>The most ridiculous rule I know of was made by my parents.<br> This rule is having to make my bed before I can leave the house. <br>I was on my way to a dinner gathering one day and I was already running 15 minutes late. <br> Walking out the door, my parents stopped me and made me go make my bed.<br> I was not very happy about this because it made me even more late to dinner.  </p>
